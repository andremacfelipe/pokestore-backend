# Pokestore Backend

> ## status: Developing

## About
<p>
    This is the back-end of my "steam-community-market-like" application.
    A application that works like the steam skins market where users are able to open cases and get unique items (unique pokemons, in this case), sell their items at the price that they prefer and also trade their items with other users.  
    I decided to start this project to pratice and improve my dev-skills. I intend to improve the documentation of this project in a near future.
